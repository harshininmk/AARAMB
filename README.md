The website was designed to be both informative and interactive, providing event details, schedules, speaker information, and live updates about the hackathon. A central feature of the platform was a real-time registration system, allowing participants to sign up, track their participation, and receive updates on important sessions and deadlines. I leveraged HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the front-end, ensuring that the site was mobile-friendly and easy to navigate across different devices. For the back-end, Node.js and Express were used to handle user data and event registrations, with data securely stored in a MongoDB database.

The event website also featured a live scoreboard for the hackathon, allowing participants to view their progress and standings in real time. This dynamic feature added an element of excitement and encouraged active participation throughout the hackathon. By integrating responsive design principles, the website ensured accessibility and ease of use for attendees, whether on desktop or mobile devices.

Overall, the project was a success, delivering a seamless and engaging online experience for the bootcamp and hackathon attendees. The website not only served as an event portal but also highlighted the power of Full Stack Web Development in creating interactive and responsive platforms for educational and professional events.
